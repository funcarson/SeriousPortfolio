  <h1>Serious Games</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Definition</h2>
    <p>Serious Games are games with the intended purpose to teach skills a person can use in the real world.</p>

    <h2>2. What I Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Trying to build a game that’s both fun and educational is a serious challenge, as you always lean one way or the other.</li>
      <li>Serious games are starting to be used everywhere for jobs, including Military, Health Care, Retail, and more!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Class Work Summary</h2>
    <p>In this class we started off with a simple premise of building a Mars rover simulation, with simulated heat and battery life with the goal of finding life. What I did was create a simple pygame with a rover who aimlessly roams around automatically, trying to find life while avoiding hot and cold spots. Then we were tasked with building a game which could be used in a Space museum. What I ended up doing was make a rover builder simulator, where the user is tasked from NASA to take pictures of various landmarks on Mars. The player builds their rover, looks for as many hotspots as they can, takes photos, then when the time runs out they turn in their photos for more funding to build a better rover, and this repeats until they’ve found all the hotspots.</p>

    <h2>6. Future Predictions</h2>
    <p>I believe serious games will be fully integrated with VR, utilizing it from on-the-job training, to military simulations. This will allow for more realistic and smarter training simulations, better preparing people for the workforce and the battlefield.</p>
